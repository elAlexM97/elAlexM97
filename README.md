###  Hello World

I'm a Visual Developer on a mission to bridge the gap between digital aesthetics and code performance.

Leveraging a formal background in **Visual Arts** and **Graphic Design**, I specialize in transforming high-fidelity designs (Figma/XD) into **pixel-perfect, highly efficient React interfaces**. My goal is to craft user experiences that are both beautiful to look at and flawlessly engineered.

-   **Currently Focused On:** Actively transitioning graphic design proficiency into effective, clean, and maintainable Front-End code.
-   **Open to Opportunities:** Seeking entry-level Front-End Developer or UI/UX development roles where I can apply my dual expertise.
- 🔗 **LinkedIn:** [alexm97](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexm97/)
